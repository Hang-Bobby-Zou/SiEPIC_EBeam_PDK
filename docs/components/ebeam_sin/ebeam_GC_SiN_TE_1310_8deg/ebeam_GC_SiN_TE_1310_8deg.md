- ebeam_GC_SiN_TE_1310_8deg

## Description

A grating coupler is used to couple light straight from a fibre to on-chip photonic components
without the need for micro-mechanics etch coupling techniques. The design is a compact
focusing grating coupler used for TE polarization at O-band with 8 degree insertion angle on the
SiN platform offered by ANT.
