## Description
This component is used to terminate a waveguide. This terminator is a nano-taper that spreads the light into the
oxide and is used for efficient edge coupling. Even if a waveguide crosses near this taper end, the reflection is
minimal. This is included in this model, 1 Î¼m away, therefore, the model is a worst-case reflection. To terminate
unused ports on components to avoid reflections, refer to Disconnected Waveguides.
